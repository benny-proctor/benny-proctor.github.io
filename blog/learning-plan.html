    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>In the distant future I aspire to be an adept, all encompassing programmer. Preferably specializing in Ruby considering the things ive heard about it.</p>
<br>
    <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
        <br>
    <p>I ponder ideas in vast scales depending on how significant I find the subject or key aspects. Mostly seeking opportunities for creativity and liberation. What hinders my performance is abysmal discipline.</p>
<br>
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>To become bilingual so I can expand my horizons, as well as general people skills.</p>
<br>
    <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>Every morning I will asses how much work I have ahead of me. Then I will divide that equally between the present and the ultimatum. I eliminate all distractions in my workspace and set small steps ahead of me. If I am ever struggling under the pressure of my workload then I will attempt to reset my focus with a short break, and revisit project resources.</p>
<br>
    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>For each problem I encounter, I will execute these steps sequentially, if the problem persists then I proceed to the next step;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Research solutions online.</li>
            <li>Seek 3rd party perspective.</li>
            <li>Ask slack channels for advice.</li>
            <li>Inquire designated cohort facilitator.</li>
        </ol>
<br>
    <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>As a student I expect a modern curriculum with adherent communication.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>Annual events such as xmas, halloween, family birthdays etc...</p>
