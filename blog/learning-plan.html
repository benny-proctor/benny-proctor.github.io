    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>In the distant future I aspire to be an adept, all encompassing programmer. Preferably specializing in Ruby considering the things ive heard about it. In terms of employment I was interested in backend web development, more specifically crypto currency contract programming.</p>
<br>
    <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
        <br>
    <p>I ponder ideas in vast scales, I pride myself on knowledge and I enjoy perceiving situations in many ways. Mostly seeking opportunities for creativity and liberation to fuel my passions. What hinders my performance is abysmal discipline in terms of time management and personal vices.</p>
<br>
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>To improve my ability to articulate smooth dialog under pressure/stress and to be more okay outside of my comfort zone.</p>
<br>
    <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>Every morning I will asses how much work I have ahead of me. Then I will divide that equally between the present and the ultimatum. I eliminate all distractions in my workspace and set small steps ahead of me. If I am ever struggling under the pressure of my workload then I will attempt to reset my focus with a short break, and revisit project resources.</p>
<br>
    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>For each problem I encounter, I will execute these steps sequentially, if the problem persists then I proceed to the next step;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Research solutions online.</li>
            <li>Ask slack channels for advice.</li>
            <li>Inquire designated cohort facilitator.</li>
        </ol>
<br>
    <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>As a student I expect to be provided with a simplified view on the problems I encounter, adherent communication with where I went wrong and where to improve.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h2>
        <br>
    <p>If I succumb to my illness theres a great chance I will be absent until I recover.</p>
