        <h1>My identity and values.</h1>
    </header>
    <ol>
    <li>1) Describe personal values and ethics:
          
        I value empathy among my loved ones, loyalty among my relationships, honesty in my life and forgiveness for my wrongs. 
    </li>	
<br> 
    <li>
        2) Describe your strengths: 
<br>       
        I can see situations from many different angles, I am esoteric with my ego and I am grateful for what has made me what I am. 
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        3) Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took:
<br>          
        Back when I was living up in auckland I was really good friends with a girl who id see almost every week. We were great to, and bad for each other. Enabling substance abuse, constant talk about toxic and intrusive thoughts. I had found someone in which I could share my pain, but when my good friend suggested to move down to wellington and start a new life, I new there was something for me here.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        4) Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:
<br>        
        As a born kiwi, I have not had much cultural influence.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        5) Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:
<br>       
        After resenting school and copious gap years my wit has dulled, its a rut I ever imagined id fall into.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        6) Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles:
<br>        
        To be able to view situations from different perspectives has served me useful but it also leads to excessive overthinking.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        7) Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why:
<br>        
        In all honestly I don't have much, if any professional background to reflect on. 
    </li>
