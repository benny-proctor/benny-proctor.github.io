<div>
    <p>Relative positioning means to shift an element from its origin, this tag only affects an element when you specify a direction and set the distance of pixels. If you wish to shift the element down you specify, position:relative; top: 10px;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Absolute positioning means to shift the element from its relative parent, now what does that even mean? Well, lets say you have two rectangles.. The first of which spans across the top half of your page and the second spans underneath. If the first box was the parent, and you only want to move the second box? You would set the child elements position to absolute, then specify distance.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Fixed positioning means that the selected element will not move in correspondence to the scroll wheel. This is good for interactive UI that a user base can use at anytime for whatever reason.</p>
